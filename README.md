## Introduction
The Patent Analysis Data Pipeline is designed to extract, transform, and analyze patent data from PubMed and GPA. By leveraging the power of Apache Spark for distributed data processing and Power BI for interactive visualization, the pipeline enables users to gain insights into patent trends, technologies, and inventors.

## Features and Uses
- Data extraction from PubMed and Google Patents through a UI built with HTML, CSS and Js
- Data cleaning and transformation using Apache Spark.
- Integration with Power BI for dynamic visualization and analysis.
- Explore Drone patent trends, technologies, and inventors using Power BI's interactive dashboards.
